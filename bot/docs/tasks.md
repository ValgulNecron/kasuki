- [ ] Add more context to errors using anyhow::Context
- [ ] Improve error recovery mechanisms in background tasks

### Testing
- [ ] Increase unit test coverage across the codebase
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical paths
- [ ] Implement automated testing for Discord command interactions
- [ ] Create mock implementations for external services (Anilist API, etc.)

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete missing documentation for public functions
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams explaining component relationships
- [ ] Create a comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Document the database schema and relationships

### Performance
- [ ] Implement more aggressive caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for database connections

### Security
- [ ] Conduct a security audit of the codebase

- [ ] Review token and credential handling

## Code-Level Improvements

### Command Structure
- [ ] Refactor command implementations to reduce code duplication
- [ ] Standardize error handling across all commands
- [ ] Implement command cooldowns to prevent abuse
- [ ] Add more comprehensive permission checking

### Background Tasks
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown for background tasks

- [ ] Improve error recovery in background tasks
- [x] Implement configurable task intervals

### Database
- [ ] Optimize database schema for better performance

- [ ] Implement better caching for GraphQL responses
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed GraphQL requests

### User Experience
- [ ] Improve command feedback and response times
- [ ] Enhance embed designs for better readability
- [ ] Add more interactive components (buttons, select menus)
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for large responses

### Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor large functions into smaller, more focused ones
- [ ] Reduce code duplication across similar commands
- [ ] Implement more comprehensive logging, this means adding more logs to the function and making the already existing one better
- [ ] Add more comments explaining complex logic
- [ ] Run clippy with pedantic settings and address warnings

### Configuration
- [ ] Move hardcoded values to configuration
- [ ] Implement environment variable support for configuration
- [ ] Add validation for configuration values
- [ ] Support hot-reloading of configuration

### Localization
- [ ] Expand localization support to all user-facing strings
- [ ] Implement a more robust localization system
- [ ] Add support for more languages
- [ ] Create a contributor guide for translations

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Address the "need a rework" file in the project root
- [ ] Complete implementation of unsupported component types (SelectMenu, InputText)
- [x] Fix commented-out code (e.g., update_anisong_db in background_launcher.rs)
- [x] Review and update error messages for clarity
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
