//! A command implementation for handling "waifu" related interactions.
//! This command uses the AniList API to fetch character data and provide responses.
//!
//! # Fields
//!
//! * `WaifuCommand`:
//!     - `ctx`: The context of the bot, containing necessary dependencies and state.
//!     - `command_interaction`: Interaction instance that holds information about the command invoked by the user.
//!
//! # Functionality
//!
//! This struct implements the `Command` trait, making it compatible with the command structure
//! of the system. It provides methods to retrieve the context and interaction details and to
//! execute the command's functionality (`get_contents`).
//!
//! ## Methods
//!
//! ### `get_ctx`
//!
//! Retrieves the current bot context.
//!
//! **Returns**:
//! - A reference to the `SerenityContext` object which contains bot-specific data and utilities.
//!
//! ### `get_command_interaction`
//!
//! Retrieves the current command interaction.
//!
//! **Returns**:
//! - A reference to the `CommandInteraction` object which holds information about the user command.
//!
//! ### `get_contents`
//!
//! Fetches the data necessary for constructing the embed response for the "waifu" command.
//!
//! **Process**:
//! - Accesses the bot's context to retrieve global bot data.
//! - Fetches AniList character information using the character ID `156323`.
//! - Utilizes the `character_content` function to create the corresponding embed structure.
//!
//! **Returns**:
//! - A `Result` containing a `Vec<EmbedContent>`, which holds the data to be displayed in the embed format, or an error if the operation fails.
//!
//! **Errors**:
//! - Returns an error if the AniList API fetch or embed content creation fails.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This struct is intended to be instantiated with the context and the interaction details provided by the Serenity framework.
//! Once instantiated, it can be executed to fetch AniList character data and produce a response containing the fetched information.
//!
//! # Example:
//! ```rust
//! let waifu_command = WaifuCommand { ctx, command_interaction };
//! let result = waifu_command.get_contents().await?;
//! ```
